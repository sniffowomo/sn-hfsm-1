## [0.8.0] - 2024-09-13

Design changes:

- The liquidation module was transformed into a hook receiver.
- Silo is now a share collateral token and implements share token functionality. So, now we have collateral share token (silo), protected share token (customized ERC-20), debt share token (customized ERC-20).
- Removed ‘bool sameAsset’ from the silo and introduced separate methods for work with the same asset.
- Removed ordered configs from the SiloConfig and introduced a collateral silo concept.
- Removed ‘leverage’ functionality from the Silo.borrow fn.
- Removed InterestRateModelV2.connect and added InterestRateModelV2.initialize. Now each silo has a different irm that is a minimal proxy and is cloned during the silo deployment like other components

## [0.7.0] - 2024-06-03
### Added
 - Refactoring of the hooks' actions and hooks inputs
 - Reentrancy bug fix in flashLoan fn

- borrow same token
  - liquidation for same token can be done with sToken without reverting
  - case observed on full liquidation: when we empty out silo, there is dust left (no shares)

### Changed
- standard reentrancy guard was replaced by cross Silo reentrancy check

### Fixed
