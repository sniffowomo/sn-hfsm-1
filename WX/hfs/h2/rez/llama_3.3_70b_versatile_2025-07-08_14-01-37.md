- ##Model: compound-beta
- ##Question: Find AI based automated web app penetesting tools that are opnsource and utilize google gemini api 

Based on the extensive search and analysis, I was unable to find a specific, widely available, open-source tool that is primarily designed for automated web app penetration testing and utilizes the Google Gemini API. However, I did come across a few tools and projects that might be relevant or could potentially be adapted to meet the criteria.

One notable tool is **PentestGPT**, an open-source, AI-powered penetration testing tool that supports multiple AI models, including Google's Gemini. While it primarily focuses on OpenAI's GPT models, it does offer flexibility with various AI models, including Gemini. PentestGPT can be installed using pip, and it provides a range of features, including automated penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and exploit development.

To utilize PentestGPT with the Google Gemini API, you would need to obtain a Gemini API key and configure it within the tool. The GitHub repository for PentestGPT provides documentation and setup instructions, including information on how to use the Gemini API.

Other tools and projects that might be of interest include:

1. **BurpGPT**: A Burp Suite extension that integrates with OpenAI's GPT models, but could potentially be adapted to work with the Google Gemini API.
2. **PutraGPT**: An open-source project that aims to provide an AI-powered penetration testing framework, but its current implementation focuses on OpenAI's GPT models.
3. **Gemini CLI**: An open-source, command-line interface for interacting with the Google Gemini API, which could potentially be used to build custom automated web app penetration testing tools.

While these tools and projects show promise, it's essential to note that they may require customization, adaptation, or further development to fully meet the criteria of being open-source, AI-based, and utilizing the Google Gemini API for automated web app penetration testing.

In summary, the most relevant tool that comes close to meeting the criteria is **PentestGPT**, which supports multiple AI models, including Google's Gemini. However, it may require additional configuration and customization to fully utilize the Gemini API for automated web app penetration testing.

Here is a code snippet to get started with PentestGPT:
```python
# Install PentestGPT using pip
pip install git+https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT

# Import the PentestGPT library
import pentestgpt

# Set up the Gemini API key
gemini_api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

# Configure PentestGPT to use the Gemini API
pentestgpt.configure(gemini_api_key=gemini_api_key)

# Start the PentestGPT tool
pentestgpt.start()
```
Please note that you will need to replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini API key.

While this answer may not provide a single, straightforward solution, it highlights the potential of PentestGPT and other tools to be adapted or customized to meet the specific requirements of AI-based automated web app penetration testing using the Google Gemini API.
