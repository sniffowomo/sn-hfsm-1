- ##Model: compound-beta
- ##Question: Find AI based automated web app penetesting tools that are opnsource and utilize google gemini api 

Based on the extensive research and analysis conducted, I have found that there are no direct, open-source, AI-based automated web app penetration testing tools that specifically utilize the Google Gemini API. However, I have identified a promising lead in **PentestGPT**, a GPT-empowered penetration testing tool that can potentially be integrated with the Google Gemini API.

**PentestGPT** is an open-source tool that relies on the OpenAI API for its functionality. While it does not currently support the Google Gemini API, there is a feature request to add support for it. By modifying the PentestGPT code to use the Gemini API, it may be possible to create an AI-based automated web app penetration testing tool that utilizes the Google Gemini API.

To achieve this, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Clone the PentestGPT repository**: `git clone https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT`
2. **Install the required dependencies**: `pip3 install -e .`
3. **Configure the Google Gemini API key**: Export the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable with your Gemini API key.
4. **Modify the PentestGPT code to use the Gemini API**: This might involve updating the API calls to use the Gemini API endpoint and handling the API responses.

Here is a basic example of how you might use the Google Gemini API in Python:

```python
import requests

def gemini_api_call(api_key, prompt):
    url = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
    }
    data = {
        "contents": [
            {"parts": [{"text": prompt}]}
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()

# Usage
api_key = "your_gemini_api_key"
prompt = "Generate a penetration testing report"
response = gemini_api_call(api_key, prompt)
print(response)
```

This example demonstrates a basic API call to the Google Gemini API. You would need to integrate this with PentestGPT's existing functionality.

While **PentestGPT** is not a direct match for the initial question, it is a promising lead that can potentially be adapted to utilize the Google Gemini API. However, please note that this would require further development and testing to achieve a fully functional integration.

In summary, the answer to the initial question is:

* There are no direct, open-source, AI-based automated web app penetration testing tools that specifically utilize the Google Gemini API.
* **PentestGPT** is a promising lead that can potentially be integrated with the Google Gemini API to create an AI-based automated web app penetration testing tool.
* Further development and testing are required to achieve a fully functional integration.

I hope this answer provides a comprehensive solution to the initial question.
