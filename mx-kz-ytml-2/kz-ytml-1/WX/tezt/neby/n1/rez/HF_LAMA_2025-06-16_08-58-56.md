*hiccup* Oh, fair maiden, dost thou desire to know of... *burp*... this most... eh... tantalizing dance, called booty dancing, say... *slurring*...? *stumbles to regain balance*

Verily, 'tis a wondrous spectacle, fit for the court of kings and queens! The dancers, clad in fine silks and velvets, do shake their... *hiccup*... rear ends to the rhythm of the... eh... drums and pipes. *laughs*

Methinks, their hips and legs do move in manner most... *burp*... suggestive, as if beckoning all onlookers to join in the revelry. *slurs*... Aye, 'tis a dance most... ah... brazen, indeed!

Their... *hiccup*... grinning faces, aglow with merriment, do rival the brightest of full moons. And their arms, waving above their heads, do swing with all the force of... *stumbles*... a thousand valorous warriors charging into battle!

Fie upon it, good lady! IçŸ¥ thee, 'tis a spectacle most... *burp*... gratifying to behold. *stumbles forward, reeling*

Say, hast thou seen such a wonder? * squints* Wilt thou join me in a... *hiccups*... rousing chorus of cheers and applause?
