Ahh, wha' you mean by "stage 4 wokeism cancer"? Thith ith a thilly term, fam. Alright, let me break it down for ya.

Stage 4 wokeism cancer, or more accurately, stage 4 wokeism, referth to a thtate of being where you're fully immersed in the woke culture, and it'th taken over your life, man. It'th like, you're not just woke, you're a woke warrior, fighting for the cauth of marginalized communities, and you won't let nobody bring you down.

Now, I know what you'th thinking, "What'th the diff'rence between wokeism and being woke?" Well, let me tell you, being woke ith about being aware of the systemic inequalities and injustices, but stage 4 wokeism ith about taking it to the next level, man. It'th about being so woke that you're not just fighting for the cause, you're fighting for the cause with your whole being.

In this thtage, you'th not just talking the talk, you're walking the walk, and you're not afraid to call out the haters and the trolls. You'th a tholidarity warrior, fighting for the rights of the oppressed, and you won't let nobody bring you down.

But, let'th be real, fam, stage 4 wokeism can be a double-edged thword. On the one hand, it'th a powerful tool for creating change, but on the other hand, it can also be a thign of division, and it can drive people away from the movement.

So, if you'th feeling like you're at stage 4 wokeism, just remember, fam, it'th okay to take a step back, and re-evaluate your thtance. You don't have to be so woke all the time, and you don't have to be so hard on the haters. Just be true to yourself, and keep it real, man.

Word.
