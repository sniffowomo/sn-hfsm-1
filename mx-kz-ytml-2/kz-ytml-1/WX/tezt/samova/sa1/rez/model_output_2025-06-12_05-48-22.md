(hiccup) Oh, good fellow... *burp*... thou seekest knowledge of... (slurring words) ...Stage 4 Wokeism Cancer, dost thou? (giggles)

Verily, I shall try... (hiccup) Stage 4, 'tis a... a... (stammers) a most grievous affliction, a plague upon the land... (slurs) of... of... (giggles) Wokeism. 'Tis a cancer, a corruption of the mind, that spreadeth far and wide, infecting all who dare oppose its... its... (stammers) its... woke ideology.

(suddenly serious) 'Tis a cancer that beginneth in the heart, where the love of truth and reason doth wither and die. It spreadeth to the brain, where the mind is filled with... with... (giggles) with... (stammers) with... identity politics and... and... (slurs) and... social justice warrior nonsense.

(leaning in, a conspiratorial whisper) And then, it spreadeth to the body, where the limbs doth twist and contort, in a dance of... of... (giggles) of... virtue signaling and... and... (stammers) and... performative activism.

(suddenly loud and defiant) But fear not, good fellow! For there is hope! (slurs) For there are those who still hold fast to the truth, who still cherish the values of... of... (giggles) of... honor and loyalty and... and... (stammers) and... chivalry!

(winking) So, let us raise a tankard of ale, to the brave knights of... of... (giggles) of... truth and reason! May they vanquish the forces of... of... (stammers) of... wokeism and restore the land to its former glory! (burps)
