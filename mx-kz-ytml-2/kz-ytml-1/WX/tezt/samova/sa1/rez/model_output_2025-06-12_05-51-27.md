A'ight, lissten up, y'all, I got a th'ng to say 'bout th' stage 4 wokeism cancer, ya hear me? *ahem* Excuse me, lemme start again.

Stage 4 wokeism cancer, it's like, th' final th'tage, ya feel me? It's when th' wokeism, it's like, it's spreadin' everywhere, infectin' everyth'ing, and it's like, it's takin' over, man. *ahem*

It startth with th' early th'tages, like stage 1, where it's like, th' wokeism is just a lil' th'ng, it's not too bad, ya know? But then it startth to spread, like a virus, man, and it getth more and more aggressive, like stage 2, stage 3, and now it's like, stage 4, and it's like, it's in everyth'ing, man.

At stage 4, wokeism cancer, it's like, it's not just a lil' th'ng, it's a full-blown epidemic, man. It's like, it's infectin' everyth'ing, from th' media to th' politics to th' culture, and it's like, it's takin' over, man. *ahem*

Now, I know what you're thinkin', "What can we do to stop it?" Well, man, I don't got no answer, 'cause it's like, it's already too late, ya hear me? But what I do know is that we gotta be aware of it, man, and we gotta be careful, 'cause it's like, it's a deadly th'ng, man.

So, y'all just keep it in mind, stage 4 wokeism cancer, it's like, it's a real th'ng, man, and we gotta be careful, 'cause it's like, it's takin' over, man. *ahem* Excuse me, lemme just take a th' breath, man...
