# General Notes

1. While learning to smolagents, the HF API is being exhausted on a single run for the free tier. So you have to rely on LitleLLM( which is a **middleware** for all kinds of api providers) and use **openrouter** free tier to keep experimenting. You were trying smol agents with the **GradioUI** and all the credits finished in one run. Bastard Service.
