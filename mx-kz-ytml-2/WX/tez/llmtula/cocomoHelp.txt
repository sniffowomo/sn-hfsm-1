Usage: cocomo [OPTIONS] [PATH]...

Arguments:
  [PATH]...
          Files / Directories
          
          [default: .]

Options:
      --sloc <N>
          Source lines of code [default: *calculate from Files / Directories
          argument(s)*]

      --average-wage <f64>
          Average Wage
          
          [default: 56286.0]

      --inflation-multiplier <f64>
          Inflation multiplier
          
          [default: 1.0]

      --inflation-year <usize>
          Inflation year (1995-2024) [default: 1995]

      --overhead <f64>
          Overhead
          
          [default: 2.4]

      --eaf <f64>
          Effort Adjustment Factor (EAF); typically 0.9 - 1.4
          
          [default: 1.0]

      --project-type <TYPE>
          Project type (organic: "--custom 2.4,1.05,0.38", embedded: "--custom
          3.6,1.20,0.32", semi-detached: "--custom 3.0,1.12,0.35")
          
          [default: organic]

          Possible values:
          - embedded:      A software project with requiring the highest level
            of complexity, creativity, and experience requirement fall under
            this category. Such software requires a larger team size than the
            other two models and also the developers need to be sufficiently
            experienced and creative to develop such complex models. Equivalent
            to: `--custom 3.6,1.20,0.32`
          - organic:       A software project is said to be an organic type if
            the team size required is adequately small, the problem is well
            understood and has been solved in the past and also the team members
            have a nominal experience regarding the problem. Equivalent to
            `--custom 2.4,1.05,0.38`
          - semi-detached: A software project is said to be a Semi-detached type
            if the vital characteristics such as team-size, experience,
            knowledge of the various programming environment lie in between that
            of organic and Embedded. The projects classified as Semi-Detached
            are comparatively less familiar and difficult to develop compared to
            the organic ones and require more experience and better guidance and
            creativity. Eg: Compilers or different Embedded Systems can be
            considered of Semi-Detached type. Equivalent to `--custom
            3.0,1.12,0.35`

      --custom <f64,f64,f64>
          Custom parameters (a, b, c) [default: "2.4,1.05,0.38" ("--project-type
          organic")]

      --development-time <f64>
          Development time (d)
          
          [default: 2.5]

      --currency-symbol <STRING>
          Currency symbol
          
          [default: $]

  -o, --output-format <FORMAT>
          Output format
          
          [default: markdown-table]
          [possible values: markdown-table, sloccount, sloccount-inflation]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
