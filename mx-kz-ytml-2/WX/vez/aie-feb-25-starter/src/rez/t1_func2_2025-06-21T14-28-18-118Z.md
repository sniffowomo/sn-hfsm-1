Several events related to AI engineering took place in 2025 under similar names, with two prominent ones being the "AI Engineer Summit: Agents at Work!" and the "AI Engineer World's Fair".

The "AI Engineer Summit: Agents at Work!" was held in New York from February 19-22, 2025. This event was described as a leading invite-only technical conference for AI engineers and leadership, focusing on advancing the field with a theme of "Agents at Work" and highlighting in-production case studies.

The "AI Engineer World's Fair 2025" took place in San Francisco from June 3-5, 2025. It was billed as a major technical AI event and the largest industry gathering dedicated to applied AI engineering.

The impact of these summits in the world of AI, based on the information available, centered on the shift from theoretical AI capabilities to practical implementation and the reality of putting AI agents to work. Key discussions and takeaways included the critical importance of robust evaluation frameworks, security measures, and reliability engineering for production AI systems. The events aimed to bring together engineers and founders at the forefront of AI engineering to share knowledge and "battle-tested patterns" for building real-world AI products. They provided a platform for the AI community to discuss challenges and propose solutions for the advancement of AI, particularly in the context of building scalable and reliable AI systems and infrastructure. The summits also facilitated networking and collaboration among major AI labs, infrastructure platforms, startups, and企业 leaders.
