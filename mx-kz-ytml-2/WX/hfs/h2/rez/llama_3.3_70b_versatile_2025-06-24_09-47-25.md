- ##Model: compound-beta
- ##Question: Find AI based automated web app penetesting tools that are opnsource and utilize google gemini api 

Based on the search results and analysis, the AI-based automated web app penetration testing tools that are open-source and utilize the Google Gemini API are:

1. **PentestGPT**: This is an open-source tool that leverages AI for penetration testing and supports multiple models, including Google's Gemini models. Although it primarily relies on OpenAI API for high-quality reasoning, it can be configured to use the Gemini API.

2. **QAutomator**: While not strictly a web app penetration testing tool, QAutomator uses the Gemini API to analyze video recordings of app usage and generate detailed functional flows, comprehensive UI-based test cases, and automated Appium code. This capability could be adapted for web app penetration testing.

No other open-source tools were found that specifically utilize the Google Gemini API for AI-based automated web app penetration testing. However, several open-source frameworks were identified that can be used to build AI agents with Google Gemini models, including:

1. **LangGraph**
2. **CrewAI**
3. **LlamaIndex**
4. **Composio**

These frameworks could potentially be used to develop custom tools for web app penetration testing that leverage the Google Gemini API.

It's worth noting that the Google Gemini API is a relatively new technology, and the ecosystem of open-source tools that utilize it is still evolving. As a result, the availability of open-source tools that meet the specific criteria of AI-based automated web app penetration testing using the Google Gemini API may be limited.

In summary, while there are no widely available open-source tools that specifically utilize the Google Gemini API for AI-based automated web app penetration testing, PentestGPT and QAutomator show promise, and the identified frameworks can be used to develop custom tools that meet this criteria. 

Here is a code snippet to get started with PentestGPT:
```python
# Install PentestGPT
pip3 install git+https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT

# Configure API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_key_here'
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_google_api_key_here'

# Test connection
pentestgpt-connection

# Start PentestGPT with default settings (GPT-4o)
pentestgpt
```
Please replace `'your_openai_key_here'` and `'your_google_api_key_here'` with your actual API keys.

For QAutomator, you can explore its capabilities and potential applications in web app penetration testing by analyzing its documentation and source code. 

```python
# QAutomator example
# No specific code snippet available, as QAutomator is primarily designed for mobile app testing
# However, you can explore its source code and documentation to adapt it for web app penetration testing
```
