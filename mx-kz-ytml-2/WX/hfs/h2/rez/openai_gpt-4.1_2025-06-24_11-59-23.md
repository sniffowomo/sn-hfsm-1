- ##Question: What is the significant war happening in June 2025

As of now (June 2024), **there is no widely recognized or documented significant war specifically occurring in June 2025**, because that date is in the future and predictions about global events, including wars, are not certain. The most significant ongoing conflicts as of mid-2024 include:

- The Russia-Ukraine war
- The Israel-Gaza conflict
- Ongoing unrest in Sudan and regions of Africa
- Tensions in various parts of Asia (e.g., South China Sea, Taiwan Strait) but not a declared war

There is **no verified information about a new or "significant war" uniquely tied to June 2025**. For news about any conflicts at that time, please consult credible news outlets as the date approaches.
